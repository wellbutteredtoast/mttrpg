## Map Data
---
This is where the ANSI data and all its metadata are located, each map gets its own source file (a humble *.txt) and then it's _implemtation file_ - which would be a Ruby source file with map-specific logic, it would only be somewhat of a mess to deal with. If there is a better approach, please help me with it!
